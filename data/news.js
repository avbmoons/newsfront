      'An earthquake of magnitude 6.5 occurred off the coast of Tonga, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Center (EMSC).\n\nThe earthquake occurred at 20.05 UTC (23.05 Moscow time) 157 kilometers southeast of the city of Neiafu with a population of about four thousand people. The hearth was located at a depth of 10 kilometers.\n\n Information about possible casualties and destruction has not yet been received.The epicenter of the earthquake, recorded at 23:06 Moscow time on Tuesday, was located about 184 km east-northeast of the city of Pangai on Lifuka Island in the Kingdom of Tonga.\n\nAccording to the intensity of the tremors in the epicenter, the earthquake is assessed as "devastating".The US Geological Survey estimated the magnitude of the earthquake at 6.6. American seismologists also recorded a second earthquake in the area with a magnitude of 4.7.\n\nIn the same month, a strong earthquake occurred off the coast of the Kuril Islands. On August 20, an earthquake of magnitude 5.4 was registered off the coast of the southern Kuril Islands. The source of the tremors lay at a depth of 95 kilometers. They were felt by residents of the urban-type settlement of Yuzhno-Kurilsk, as well as in the villages of Malokurilskoye and Krabozavodskoye.',

      'On Tuesday, 95,000 people took part in rallies in France against pension reform and for higher salaries, the Interior Ministry of the republic reported.\n\n"A total of 95,000 people turned out for 250 demonstrations in France on Tuesday, including 11,000 in Paris," the ministry said.\n\nAt the same time, one of the organizers of the actions, the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) trade union, reported 170,000 participants throughout France. The actions were held at the call of the CGT, FSU and Solidaires trade unions, as well as youth organizations. They called on citizens to go on strikes and demonstrate on the day when the new Prime Minister Michel Barnier outlined his reform plan to Parliament. The strikes did not affect the work of the capitals transport. At the same time, 6% of the teaching staff in the educational sector did not go to work, Monde reported.\n\nThe protesters also demanded to raise the minimum wage and lower the retirement age to 60 years.In September, at the call of leftist parties in France, demonstrations were held twice demanding the resignation of President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Michel Barnier.\n\nOn Wednesday, the legislative commission of the National Assembly, the lower house of the French parliament, will consider a resolution on the impeachment of Macron, nominated by Jean-Luc Melenchons party, the "Rebellious France".\n\nBarnier on Tuesday announced the possibility of adjusting the pension reform, which caused a wave of protests in French society, as well as his intention to reduce the budget deficit by raising taxes for the rich.',

    description:
      'The travel industry hopes that by the beginning of the next summer season, Vityaz-Aero Airline, which has had its operators certificates revoked by the Federal Air Transport Agency due to the helicopter crash, will be able to resume operations, as it will be difficult for the region to cope with the growing tourist flow without a carrier.\n\n"Given the natural conditions, Kamchatka is simply doomed to helicopter transportation. Obviously, an alternative is needed, but previous attempts to bring small aircraft to the peninsula have not been successful, and the current ones are being delayed. We really hope that by the beginning of the high season, all claims against Vityaz-Aero will be lifted, and the carrier will be operational again, in the context of changes and increased attention to pilot training.", - said Vadim Mamontov, Vice President of the Russian Union of Travel Industry, CEO of RussiaDiscovery.\n\nAccording to Irina Sedova, Director of Kamchatka Tourism and Chairman of the Kamchatka Tourism Industry Association, helicopter tours in the region are almost not in demand in winter, but tourists have been increasingly booking trips for next summer in advance in recent years, and there are reservations now.\n\n"In January, the issue of the air carrier and the required number of vessels will become more acute for all tour operators. On the other hand, there is a practice that we book a helicopter tour if tourists book it, for example, six months before the trip, but we charge the fee much closer to the departure date, since there is always some unpredictability with such excursions. This is due not so much to the airline as to the weather and other conditions. We hope that by the summer season the authorities will find a way out of the situation, because helicopter tours are one of the visiting cards of Kamchatka," Sedova said.\n\nAlexander Moroz, director of the Snow Valley mountain and sports base located near the Vilyuchinsky volcano, also believes that Kamchatka tourism will not have any special problems in winter, since the tourist flow is small.The Vityaz-Aero Mi-8T helicopter crashed on August 31 in the area of the Vachkazhets mountain range, near the village of Nikolaevka in the Yelizovsky district. There were 22 people on board, 19 of whom were tourists and guides. They all died. After investigating the causes of the accident, the carriers certificates for commercial air transportation, aviation operations, and the certificate of a general aviation operator were revoked.',

      'A 17th-century cello made by Italian master Giovanni Batista Roggeri, a student of Amati, which was part of the State Collection of unique musical instruments in Russia, was returned to the country after being abducted almost 30 years ago, said Irina Volk, a representative of the Russian Interior Ministry.\n\nPONA noted that this was done "thanks to the coordinated work of police officers from several countries" and called it "a unique international operation.\n\n"The pinstool, which belonged to the Russian National Museum of Music, was stolen in 1995 from a musician to whom it was given for temporary use. In fact, a criminal case was opened on a particularly large theft, and the cello was entered into the Interpol database.\n\n"In 2018, the instrument was found put up for sale at an auction in France. It was withdrawn from the auction," said the Wolf.\n\n Later, the Russian police established that the cello had been transported to Italy. At the request of the Russian side, it was seized by Italian police and placed in storage at the cultural heritage protection unit of the Carabinieri of Florence. Recently, in Florence, the instrument was handed over to the staff of the National Security Service of Interpol of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia.\n\n"After conducting an expert study of the cultural heritage object, the Italian side decided to return it to the Russian Federation," the representative of the department summed up.',

    description:
      'A metal implant was found in the hand of one of the mummies found in Peru. The Daily Mail writes about this.\n\n In September 2023, the controversial journalist and ufologist Jaime Maussan presented to the public the strange remains that he passes off as "alien mummies." The man is sure that the mummies allegedly found on the Nazca Plateau, Peru, belong to aliens. These three-toed creatures are called "Nazca tridactyls.\n\n"According to a Daily Mail reporter, the scientists decided to dissect one of the discovered samples. They studied the severed arm of a tridactyl and came across a metal plate implanted in it. "This is a very complex metal alloy that requires special knowledge and techniques to obtain it of such quality and purity," said forensic scientist Jose Zalce Benitez. He stated that the alloy allegedly contains metals such as aluminum, tin, silver, copper, cadmium and osmium.\n\nIn September 2023, Maussan presented his hypotheses to the Mexican Congress. However, then the forensic medical examination of the Peruvian prosecutors office found animal and human bones in the mummies and recognized them as crudely made fakes. Benitez noted that the hand he studied does not belong to the remains that Maussan represented in Congress, but it is similar to them.\n\nEarlier, Maussan said that objects similar to mobile phones were implanted in the chest of the alleged aliens. According to him, these are metal plates made of osmium, a rare toxic metal used in the space industry.',

      'For the first time, scientists have been able to decode the DNA of a person mentioned in the Old Norse saga. This was reported by the iScience portal.\n\nWe are talking about the "Sverrir Saga", which takes place in 1177-1202. The book mentions a military raid on Sverresborg Castle, during which the besiegers of the fortress threw a dead man into a well, after which they covered the body with stones. It is noted that this could have been done in order to infect the water and deprive the inhabitants of the castle of drinking water.\n\nIn 1938, during excavations of the ruins of Sverresborg, remains were found under a layer of earth and stones. In 2016, the body was extracted and the nuclear genome of the remains was decoded. According to radiocarbon dating, these remains belong to a man who lived about 900 years ago. He was between 30 and 40 years old at the time of his death. Scientists also note that he was more likely to have blue eyes, light skin tone and light or light brown hair.\n\nEarlier in Denmark, archaeologists found 50 Viking skeletons during six months of excavation.',

One in three considered their cat to be a child or a best friend and considered her devoted, supportive and empathetic," the publication notes.\n\nPeople who own a cat have a lower risk of death from cardiovascular diseases, the article says. Pets are no less useful for psychological well-being. In patients with depression, stroking or playing with a cat reduces the symptoms of the disease, according to Medicalexpress.\n\nEarlier, general practitioner Sergey Alendeev dispelled a number of myths about the beneficial effects of cats on the health of their owners, and also told what benefits pets bring.

    title: 'Nature`s Challenge: Can Supernova outbreaks cause cancer and mutations',
    description:
      'Russian scientists have hypothesized that supernova outbreaks can cause cancer and mutations on Earth. According to their research, high-energy particles, as they pass through the atmosphere, contribute to the formation of the radioactive carbon isotope C-14. It spreads in the biosphere and accumulates in the human body. In particular, it is embedded in DNA molecules and, upon decomposition, can disrupt their structure, which contributes to the development of cell development. Experts noted that with a normal radiation background, the effect of C-14 is negligible.\n\nScientists from the A.F. Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology (PHTI) of the Russian Academy of Sciences came to the conclusion that cosmic rays, which were formed during the outbursts of supernovae near the Earth, can cause cancer, genetic pathologies and mutations in the inhabitants of our planet.\n\nAt the same time, a large number of high-energy particles are released into space.\n\nThe experts` conclusions are based on calculations according to which, when such cosmic particles pass through the upper layers of the Earth`s atmosphere, the content of radioactive carbon C-14 increases abruptly in comparison with the usual background. It occurs when highâ€”energy neutrons collide with nitrogen nuclei, the main gas in our planet`s atmosphere. Subsequently, C-14 spreads relatively rapidly in the biosphere and eventually enters the human body. There it becomes a source of internal radioactive radiation.\n\nâ€” Carbon is one of the basic atoms in organic molecules. Embedded in them, C-14, just like ordinary C-12 carbon, circulates in nature and eventually accumulates in the human body. This is dangerous because, for example, DNA, a molecule that carries hereditary information, basically contains carbon chains," explained Anatoly Pavlov, one of the authors of the study, a senior researcher at the Laboratory of Mass Spectrometry at the Institute of Physics and Technology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.According to him, if C-14 is present in the DNA helix, then there is a possibility that at some point it will disintegrate.\n\nThis can cause damage to the DNA molecule and change the genetic program of the cell. As a result, errors in cell development can trigger cancer, genetic pathologies, or mutations.',

    description:
      'The start of the Russian Grand Prix has shown that men`s singles is turning into the main form of figure skating in the country\n\nThe first stage of the Russian Grand Prix ended in Magnitogorsk on Sunday. He became another proof of the trend of the last couple of seasons in isolation â€” the main showmen in Russian figure skating were men`s singles. The girls who brought this sport to glossy magazines and Channel One are fading into the shadows. The main events of the first major tournament of the season are described in the Izvestia article.\n\nThe men`s competitions in Magnitogorsk were held with such density and nervousness that many international tournaments would envy. After the short program, the whole six were in several points: Roman Savosin, Nikolai Ugozhaev, Mark Kondratyuk, Egor Rukhin, Evgeny Semenenko and Ivan Popov. Popov and Rukhin are certainly not the leaders of the national team, so their appearance in the top was a pleasant surprise. But even more surprising is that Rukhin, who returned from oblivion after wandering through the schools of Tutberidze, Plushenko and others, did five fours in the free program! He almost fell off Rittberger, but landed.\n\nBut Mark Kondratyuk has become a real superman, who this season surprises with a choice of music â€” dubstep in the short program and Indian motifs in the free program (if only he could promote it on Indian YouTube, there would be billions of views). Mark not only performed his five fours almost flawlessly â€” the most difficult flip, lutz, sheepskin coat and two salchows, but also made a unique triple axel + triple axel sequence, set the audience on fire, and after the rental he also depicted a seal on the ice â€” that`s the name of his team in the virtual Champions League of figure skaters, which Channel One announced before The Grand Prix.\n\nThat`s why Kondratyuk was emotionally celebrating a successful rental, but he was lamenting and clutching his head when he saw that he had received 199.44 points instead of 200. But the amount of 289.54 would allow us to count on medals from international competitions. Only the bronze medalist of the Beijing team has yet to break through to them â€” he plays for CSKA.\n\nThe second place belongs to Roman Savosin, who wisely abandoned the new program for Sergei Rachmaninoff and returned last year`s hit under Adriano Celentano. The third is Evgeny Semenenko, and he is hardly happy with this result after his reinsurance and mistake on Salchow.',

      'The new model of the Japanese brand Honda will be officially presented in Russia for the first time in more than two years. As Izvestia found out, it will be an Odyssey series minivan. After the sanctions were imposed in 2022, Japanese car companies began to adhere to a policy of "silence" â€” those who remained in Russia did not declare this too loudly. Therefore, the situation with the launch of a new model on the market may become a kind of event. About what a fresh Honda is, see the Izvestia article.\n\nA new model of the Japanese company Honda will appear on the Russian market, Izvestia found out. This Odyssey minivan is the next generation of this series.The design of the car has been updated, it has been equipped with a hybrid installation: the car is powered by a two-liter gasoline engine paired with an electric motor, which together produce 184 hp. \n\nThe Japanese cabin is equipped with functions that are already mandatory for the class of comfortable minivans. For example, these are split second-row seats, a table with cup holders and the possibility of folding third-row seats to enlarge the luggage compartment. The rear doors of the car open and close using gestures.\n\nThe wheelbase of the Honda Odyssey is 2900 mm, the length is 4861 mm, the width is 1820 mm, and the height is 1712 mm. That is, it can accommodate people of high stature. With the third row seats folded down, the luggage compartment volume is 1.7 thousand liters.\n\nâ€” The Honda Odyssey has never been introduced in Russia. And, taking advantage of the possibility of parallel imports, we decided to withdraw it," Maxim Zheleznyak, a representative of the exclusive distributor of Honda Motor, Motor Place, told Izvestia.\n\nOver the past 2.5 years, Japanese car brands have not officially introduced new models to the Russian market, experts told Izvestia.\n\nâ€” Not a single new model was officially presented. Moreover, some have stopped working in Russia altogether," explained the editorâ€”in-chief of the portal. Quto.ru Maxim Rakitin. â€” For example, Nissan. Therefore, there are no official supplies from them.Vladimir Bezukladnikov, Chairman of the organizing committee of the Car of the Year in Russia award, also spoke about the lack of new models for Russia.\n\nBack in 2022, Japanese car companies imposed a ban on the export of luxury goods to Russia, including expensive premium cars," he said. â€” Japan has also banned the shipment to Russia of new and used cars with engines over 1.9 liters, hybrids and electric cars.\n\nThat, only the parallel import path is currently available.',

    title: 'Without itching and consequence: skin lymphoma will be diagnosed using microRNAs',
    description:
      'Russian scientists have found a way to diagnose one of the most common types of cutaneous limophoma, fungal mycosis, by studying microRNA expression. With this disease, a person is concerned about severe, sometimes unbearable itching, and spots and plaques appear on the skin, which are often confused with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. The new technique increases the accuracy of disease detection by 90%, which will allow timely prescribing treatment to patients.\n\nThe Sechenov University Clinical Center for Health Sciences, together with the Kurchatov Institute Research Center, found a way to increase the accuracy of diagnosis of fungal mycosis in the early stages by up to 90% using microRNA expression studies. Mycosis fungi is the most common form of T-cell lymphoma of the skin (a malignant tumor disease), which is also called Alibert-Bazin disease.\n\nThe classic form of this ailment is usually expressed by red spots on the skin, plaques or nodules, which often ulcerate. Externally, it may look like mushroom caps, hence the name "mushroom mycosis". The patient is worried about severe, sometimes unbearable itching," the director of the V.A. Clinic for Skin and Venereal Diseases told Izvestia. Olga Olisova, Rakhmanova of Sechenov University.\n\nFungal mycosis can occur for years and even decades, although there are more rapid forms of the disease. With timely diagnosis, the probability of successful treatment is high.\n\nâ€” There are good results of therapy in the third stage, when nodes have already formed, but, of course, the earlier treatment begins, the better the prognosis. There is no talk of a definitive cure yet, but it is possible to stop the spread of the disease and achieve long-term remission. If nothing is done, the disease will lead to death," said the professor.\n\nMeanwhile, early diagnosis of the disease is difficult, as T-cell lymphoma initially resembles chronic benign dermatoses, such as eczema, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or parapsoriasis. The diagnosis is made on the basis of a comprehensive diagnosis, including the clinical picture of the disease and data from histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic diagnostic methods of the biopsy of the affected skin. But even such a variety of diagnostic methods does not always help in making a diagnosis at an early stage, the authors of the study note.',
